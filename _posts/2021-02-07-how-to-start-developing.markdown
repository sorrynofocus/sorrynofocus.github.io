TODO:
* give steps in getting into development
* do you have the motivation to create, troubleshoot? do you like to solve puzzles?
* learn basic math
* learn about variables
* ask yourself what type of development interest you: web, applications, mobile?
* choose the language based on platforms and interest. 
* learn language
* don't learn too much.. learn, try some code, and learn more. Learning too much will invest less time actually _learning to use it_.
