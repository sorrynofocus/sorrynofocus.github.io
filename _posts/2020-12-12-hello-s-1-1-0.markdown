Hello S-1-1-0! 
What is S-1-1-0 you ask? It means "everybody" - the world really in a Microsoft Security Identifier sense. It 's a security group that includes all users, even anonymous users, and guests. Instead of the casual _Hello, world!_ I thought I'd give it a twist. <BR>

What is _Hello, world!_? *sigh*

_Hello, world_ is a test program when you first write code as a beginner, or a _n00b_. I once proudly boasted my first _Hello, world!_ a long time ago. 

Here's an example _Hello, world_ code in C#.

{% highlight ruby %}

// Hello World! program
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Hello {         
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}

#=> prints 'Hello, world!' to STDOUT.

{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Microsoft SID doc][ms-sid-docs] for more info on Security Identifiers. You can read more _Hello, world!_ history at [Software Guild's blog page][hello-world-history]. 

### Getting to the point, world...
The point of this Hello, world is to give the statement to whomever is reading this blog. It is the beginning.... The beginning in reading topics on various things I manage to think of.
