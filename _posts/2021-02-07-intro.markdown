thanks for stopping by and reading the introduction to my blog. this is where i will post for now on,

## i love sundae
I love sundae. Ice-cream. It's an addition I cannot get away from. Eugene, a dear friend of mine, and I have a running joke about frozen yogurt. This is because I used to frequent a frozen custard stand in Portmouth, Virginia. This was the most, amazing, fozen custard I've ever laid my tongue on. The word _amazing_ might be too vain to say... but actually, I'm not. You _will_ have to visit and try it for yourself. Nothing in the universe comes close to the quality.  
The name of this _fine_ place is named _Uncle Rick's Frozen Custard_ and come to think of it, my friend Eugene had it confused thinking they sold yogurt.

<P>I miss this place about Virginia. It served me many memories with special people in my ilfe. They know who they are. If you ever find yourself in Portsmouth, stop on by:</P>

## I love tech
I love tech. Have been in it since I was a young little punk.

![I love tech]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lightballs.png)
Things I cannot get enough of:
* Reverse engineering
* Creating tools that are useful
* Windows and Linux. I am _not_ an Apple fan.
* Astrophhysics
* Laptops and Rigs

>NOTE: There are things in tech I cannot stand. This is the dish washer. The most ineffcient fucking thing in the universe.


TODO write:
* why do you like tech?
* how did you get started?
* the people who have motivated you during career

In act 3, title why this blog exists?
* why use this blog?
* what will be in it?
