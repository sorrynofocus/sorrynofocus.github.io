thanks for stopping by and reading the introduction to my blog. this is where i will post for now on,

## i love sundae
i love sundae. ice-cream. it is an addition i cannot get away from. a dear, daer friend in south africa (za) and I have a running joke about frozen yogurt. this was established because i used to frequent this frozen custard stand in portmouth, virginia. this was the most, amazing, fozen yogurt and custard i've ever laid my tongue on. the word _amazing_ may be in vain actually, but i'm not being total bs. you _will_ have to visit and try it for yourself. nothing in the universe comes close to the quality.  The name of this fine place is named _Uncle Rick's Frozen Custard_ and come to think of it, my friend Eugene had it confused thinking they sold yogurt.

## I love tech
I love tech. Have been in it since I was a young little punk.

![I love tech]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lightballs.png)
Things I cannot get enough of:
* Reverse engineering
* Creating tools that are useful
* Windows and Linux. I am _not_ an Apple fan.
* Astrophhysics
* Laptops and Rigs

>NOTE: There are things in tech I cannot stand. This is the dish washer. The most ineffcient fucking thing in the universe.
